### Program Summary

Program that send out APR (Academic Performance Report) to each individual in the class if they are performing poorly, which is 70% under their grade. This is based of the number of points on assignments and the number of attendance. This program will send out every quarter number of points. Each student's score is compared to a superuser, which is scores that have 100%. In order to extract the points and data from the Google Sheets, we use Sheetshuttle, Allegheny College student-created program that is able to have interactions with Google Sheets. To send out the email, we are going to use the Gmail API.
