### Program Summary

Creating accessibility for the social media public to see what is the current daily trend on music. This is using the Spotify API to search through metadata of music and tweets it out through an message from Twitter bot. This program is coded using the Python language to easily understand what the program is doing. The tweet is sent out through analyzing how much plays are made from the music and also how popular it is in the current point in time. However, the current program could not run since the bot is inactive.
