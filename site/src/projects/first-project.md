### Program Summary

Creating a program using the C language to create a management system for restaurants to use. This programs understands the use of multidimensional arrays and structs in order to allocate different variables of one object. Has functions for determining how much of finances are being made (Profit-Loss Margin, Indirect and Direct Costs, etc.) and inventory stock (How much left after 1 dish is made?). This program will parse through a .txt file that contains an input and the user can look through the menu.
