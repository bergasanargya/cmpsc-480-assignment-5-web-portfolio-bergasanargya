# Your attitude determines your altitude, the more positive you are, the higher you can get with your life. 

My life as a computer scientist student has been a journey full of ups and downs. Although this is just the start of my expedition, there is still a lot to learn in order to create a positive impact in this world. 

### Family

I am born in Jakarta, Indonesia on December 8, 2002. I am the oldest in the family of 4, with 1 younger sibling. My father can be described as one of the most hard-working individuals I have met as he is the example on how to succeed in the current generation I am living. He encapsulates himself in the world of statistics and mathematics, working in the finance private industry for all his life. This is the same case for my mother, who also loves statistics and mathematics. One thing that I would like to take away from my mother is the way she is always setting an example to people, that she is always happy regardless of the situation she is in. 

On the other hand, my younger sister is unique in her own way. She is only 1 year younger, attending her freshman year at Michigan State University majoring in Economics and minor in Arts. She is one of the most determined people I have ever met, where she ahs set a goa l for herself in order to be successful in her own life. 

### Education

Living in a quiet neighborhood where I am immersed in the peace of finding that ultimate goal, "What is something out there that I can do to make a positive impact in the world?" First of all, I think of athletics because I am patriotic to my country. That is why for all of the years I am in school, I am a golfer. I have represented Indonesia in various competitions both national and international. The grind of working and practicing nearly 20 hours a week showed how to become the best golfer I can be. 

However, these skills are not only applicable in golf, but in my academics. Attending Binus School Simprug, an IB (International Baccalaureate) program have made me more independent and resilient on all the accountabilities I hold. Before I got into Computer Science, I am enthusiastic in Mathematics, learning how statistics and probability are used in the real life world. I also am interested in Marketing, because this is one of the subjects that is lacking in the current world. 

Attending Allegheny College outside of my home nation of Indonesia is a different experience. Migrating from a metropolitan city to a town that only has 15,000 people open mind up on who I could meet and interact to find my better self. In addition, studying in a quiet setting help me find the new interest, Computer Science. Learning the different languages such as Python, Java and C along with the different programming styles have made me more adaptable not only with software programming but in life as well. 

### Personal Recollections

**Memory #1:** The first recollection I have is when I was playing in an international golf tournament in San Diego, California in 2014. In that point in time, I was thinking to myself that I could get my first top 5 finish in an international setting. That came crashing down when it came to Hole #11, where one of the spectators blamed me for a misconduct. Since I was not mature enough to understand what is going on, that anger and frustration affected me negatively because I felt that I have to comply to that spectator. I lost that hope of a top 5 finish and another disappointing result. What I can take away from this memory is no one will care on your success, only myself will understand how to get the success that we wanted. 

**Memory #2:** The second recollection I have is when I lead one of the biggest high school varsity competitions across Jakarta. This memory on managing different individuals in the interest of the public have been a success not only to the people who attended the event but also myself. I have developed the skill to be humble on what I do as not being self-centered will get me further down the road. 

### Interests

Outside of the world of programming, I love music. My favorite genre is alternative R&B, which is a genre that is upbeat yet mellow that give continuous harmony everytime I listen to it. That is why Khalid is my favorite singer because everytime he releases a new song, I am always ecstatic to hear it. 

In addition to music, I love travelling. I believe in the beauty to travel all around the world because every place that we travel to has something unique to share. Until now, my favorite place to travel is Japan because it is the culture that is humble and polite, where they have a pragmatic approach to situations and challenges while enjoying entertainment along the way. The biggest plus of travelling is definitely the food because food is the best representation on what a culture is in the eyes of the world.
